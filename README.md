### Results of Mapping Earthquakes
Our initial chart was to display the starting and ending locations. We can easily see that most of the starting and ending locations are in the middle of the city.


Starting Locations      |  Ending Locations

Viewing the checkout times by users and genders we can see that males are much more likely to checkout bikes for 3-6 hours. When viewing the non gender version of the graph it shares this similarity which tells us a large percentage of the bike users are male.

Viewing the trips by weekday and hour breakdown we can clearly see that monday through friday users will often use the bikes in the morning and the evening to commute to and from work. On weekends we see a larger spread between those hours as users are more likely out and about throughout the day.

When viewing the user trips by Gender we can see that males are the most likely to be subscribers. The unknown is likely the most used for customers who have not filled out a profile.

### Summary
The various images and charts help us visualize bike usage by location, time of day, length of hours, and also split between genders. Some further options we can look to chart for more data would be:
* We can map the top 10 most used locations (most bikes checked out) and increase the security at those locations as well as the amount of repairs provided at those stations.
* Find the most used long distance routes and make sure there are places on the route where users can repair or swap out bikes if needed.
